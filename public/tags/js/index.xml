      <description>The Problem Now-a-days, I&amp;rsquo;m working on the ringleader project. And just yesterday, me and one of my team mates Utkarsh observed that there were a couple of errors being generated in our javascript code. Some investigation revealed the source of errors to be a copy of an array which contained the same reference as the original array. Thus, a change in the copy was leading to a change in the original array as well.</description>
