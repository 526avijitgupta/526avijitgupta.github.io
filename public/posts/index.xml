      <description>The Problem Now-a-days, I&amp;rsquo;m working on the ringleader project. And just yesterday, me and one of my team mates Utkarsh observed that there were a couple of errors being generated in our javascript code. Some investigation revealed the source of errors to be a copy of an array which contained the same reference as the original array. Thus, a change in the copy was leading to a change in the original array as well.</description>

      <description>Every year, Google invites open source projects from various organizations so that students across the globe can contribute to them as a part of Google Summer of Code program. I was fortunate enough to be a part of GSoC-16 under the organization Oppia. Before I go on and detail my journey, let me tell you something about myself: I am Avijit Gupta, a Computer Science undergraduate who loves to contribute to Open Source.</description>

      <title>Why Spacemacs ?</title>

      <description>What is spacemacs ? Generally speaking, spacemacs is an open source Emacs distribution, aimed at providing a bridge (or a common ground, as some may call it) between Emacs and Vim
 The best editor is neither Emacs nor Vim, it&amp;rsquo;s Emacs and Vim!
 Yes, you read it right! If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard of the Editor War, then it becomes a deal breaker. Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users - you can even mix the two editing styles.</description>

      <description>Since this is an introductory post, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it short and simple. This is my first blog post after shifting to a new setup of writing. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see the journey beginning.
What setup have I shifted to for my blog, and what advantages does it offer ? Lately, after playing around with a couple of static site generators (like - Metalsmith, WinterSmith, Hexo) and also deciding against the idea of building my own, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally consolidated upon Jekyll for now, primarily because of the automatic deployment and setup with GitHub.</description>
