Since this is an introductory post, I'll keep it short and simple. This is my first blog post after shifting to a new setup of writing. I'm excited to see the journey beginning.

#### What setup have I shifted to for my blog, and what advantages does it offer ?

Lately, after playing around with a couple of static site generators (like - [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/), [WinterSmith](http://wintersmith.io/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/)) and also deciding against the idea of building my own, I've finally consolidated upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for now, primarily because of the automatic deployment and setup with GitHub. If you want to read more about it, follow this [Github help article](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/). My 2-hour search for a theme ultimately landed me to using [Indigo](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo). It seems very minimalistic and clean, with the primary focus being the content.
